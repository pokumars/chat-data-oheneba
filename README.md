## Description
This project was built with React. I made a production version of it which I then serve with express. It is deployed to Heroku.

It serves some information from giosg's API in a given time-frame about messaging statistics

## How to use the web app

Select start date, end date and put in your access token and the data will be served.
Each time you restart the application, it will automatically fetch based on the
last thing you searched and also use the access token you saved the previous time.
It goes without saying that you must be connected to the internet for it to work.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
